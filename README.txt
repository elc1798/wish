Welcome to Anguish, a shell made from the tears and sorrows of underage
programmers. Unlike most good shells, Anguish is a bit restrictive and requires
there to have a space between every operator. Hence "ls>file" will not work,
while "ls > file" will. Run Anguish with "make run" or "make; ./anguish"
